Ember-cli-yuidoc\n\nThis is an ember-cli addon for generate html documentation from YUIDoc comments in the source code.\n\n## Installation\n\nIf you're using ember-cli > 0.1.5, you can just run `ember install ember-cli-yuidoc` and you're done.\n\nIf you are using an older version, first install the addon from npm with `npm install --save-dev ember-cli-yuidoc`.\n\nThen, you need to add a `yuidoc.json` manifest on the root of your project. Run `ember g ember-cli-yuidoc` to generate\nonce with some sensitive defaults.\n\n##  Usage\n\n### As an ember command\n\nThis addon adds a new `ember-cli-yuidoc` command to ember-cli to generate the documentation on demand. \n\nJust run `ember ember-cli-yuidoc` and your docs will apear in your output directory (`/docs` by default).\nYou probably want to add this folder to the `.gitignore`.\n\n### Watch mode\n\nThis plugin also integrates with the ember server, so you can access your docs from the browser in the `/docs` urls.\nThe documentation will update when you modify your code, as expected. \n\nWhile this is specially useful if your are editing your documentation, it adds some overhead to your build pipeline,\nso this is disabled by default. Run `ember serve --docs` to enable it.\n\n### Environment specific generation\n\nThis plugin supports the ability to force generate your documentation via the `enabledEnvironments` option that may be defined in your `yuidoc.json`.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"sample-app\",\n  \"version\": \"1.2.3\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"enabledEnvironments\": [\"development\", \"production\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis will generate your documentation when using `ember build` `ember build --environment=production` `ember s` and so on without needing to use `--docs`.\n\n## Like coffescript? It's ok.\n\nThe plugin supports coffescript out of the box. In your application's `yuidoc.json` you can configure\nthe `syntaxtype` and `extension` like this: \n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"sample-app\",\n  \"version\": \"1.2.3\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"paths\": [\"app\"],\n    \"exclude\": \"vendor\",\n    \"outdir\": \"docs\",\n    \"syntaxtype\": \"coffee\",\n    \"extension\": \".coffee\"\n  }\n}\n```\n","maintainers":[{"name":"cibernox","email":"miguel.camba@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2017-02-25T23:40:30.460Z","created":"2014-10-23T01:00:12.378Z","0.0.1":"2014-10-23T01:00:12.378Z","0.0.2":"2014-10-23T01:14:51.786Z","0.0.3":"2014-10-23T01:20:16.595Z","0.0.4":"2014-10-23T01:27:50.173Z","0.0.5":"2014-10-23T01:37:27.221Z","0.0.6":"2014-10-23T08:18:22.689Z","0.0.7":"2014-10-23T08:21:57.623Z","0.0.8":"2014-10-23T14:30:16.568Z","0.0.9":"2014-10-23T20:19:43.191Z","0.0.10":"2014-10-23T22:33:03.059Z","0.1.0":"2014-10-23T22:48:17.130Z","0.1.1":"2014-10-23T23:28:02.810Z","0.1.2":"2014-10-30T20:50:41.028Z","0.1.3":"2014-10-31T23:03:21.633Z","0.1.4":"2014-11-04T17:01:03.815Z","0.1.5":"2014-11-04T17:50:18.252Z","0.2.0":"2014-11-05T01:17:30.643Z","0.2.1":"2014-11-05T01:57:27.116Z","0.3.0":"2014-11-05T17:33:11.333Z","0.3.1":"2014-11-06T00:19:32.539Z","0.4.0":"2015-01-23T12:49:26.516Z","0.5.0":"2015-02-08T11:30:34.295Z","0.5.1":"2015-02-08T11:54:54.883Z","0.5.2":"2015-02-08T12:13:05.768Z","0.5.3":"2015-02-08T13:04:16.425Z","0.5.4":"2015-02-15T14:34:02.675Z","0.6.0":"2015-03-09T00:45:37.397Z","0.6.1":"2015-03-17T08:49:07.219Z","0.6.2":"2015-03-22T14:17:32.220Z","0.7.0":"2015-05-10T16:45:56.242Z","0.7.1":"2015-07-09T00:00:43.194Z","0.7.2":"2015-07-12T19:18:37.323Z","0.7.3":"2015-07-28T13:55:41.287Z","0.8.0":"2015-08-24T21:54:45.838Z","0.8.1":"2015-10-31T16:43:57.271Z","0.8.2":"2016-01-05T10:27:26.905Z","0.8.3":"2016-01-20T13:13:27.347Z","0.8.4":"2016-06-27T21:25:24.631Z","0.8.5":"2016-07-18T22:38:50.868Z","0.8.6":"2016-07-21T11:58:56.147Z","0.8.7":"2016-07-21T15:40:19.469Z","0.8.8":"2017-02-25T23:40:30.460Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/cibernox/ember-cli-yuidoc#readme","keywords":["ember-addon","yuidoc"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/cibernox/ember-cli-yuidoc.git"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/cibernox/ember-cli-yuidoc/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"knownasilya":true,"adammokan":true,"codebruder":true},"author":{"name":"Miguel Camba"},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"58b215ee-12611\"","_lastModified":"Sat, 25 Feb 2017 23:40:30 GMT"}

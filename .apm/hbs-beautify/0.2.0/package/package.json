Supports Handlebar tags within comments. Use {{!--...--}}\n\natom-beautify's handlebars formatting breaks if handlebars comments contain inline tags `{{...}}`. This package adds support for including handlebars tags inside comments without breaking formatting. Long commenting standard (`{{!--...--}}`) needs to be used for formatting to work with inline tags.\n\nExample\n```handlebars\n{{!--\n  foo partial comments\n  Example:\n  {{> foo-partial}}\n--}}\n```\n\nKeyboard shortcut:\n`ctrl-alt-[`\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jaichandra/hbs-beautify/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jaichandra/hbs-beautify#readme","_id":"hbs-beautify@0.2.0","_shasum":"6eb326b7fa3247bd91f52138fea0023b99f646fb","_resolved":"file:../d-117013-73395-1sy8fjs/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117013-73395-1sy8fjs/package.tgz"}

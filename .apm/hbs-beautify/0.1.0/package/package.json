Supports Handlebar tags within comments. Use {{!--...--}}\n\natom-beautify's handlebars formatting breaks if handlebars comments contain inline tags `{{...}}`. This package adds support for including handlebars tags inside comments without breaking formatting. Long commenting standard (`{{!--...--}}`) needs to be used for formatting to work with inline tags.\n\nExample\n```handlebars\n{{!--\n  foo partial comments\n  Example:\n  {{> foo-partial}}\n--}}\n```\n\nKeyboard shortcut:\n`ctrl-alt-[`\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/jaichandra/hbs-beautify/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/jaichandra/hbs-beautify#readme","_id":"hbs-beautify@0.1.0","_shasum":"541f397b60986e865b33e6fc7b5879788462f600","_resolved":"file:../d-11704-15500-r0vzmq/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11704-15500-r0vzmq/package.tgz"}
